# Matlab_Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a matlab implementation of Tic Tac Toe with multiple levels and modes of gameplay.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe. The home screen allows the user to choose between playing against another user, playing against the computer, or simulating games
between two computer players. In player versus computer mode, the user can choose the computer opponent's level. The computer plays completely randomly in easy mode. In 
intermediate mode, the computer plays randomly at first, but will actively try to block the user if they are about to win, and actively try to win if they are only
one space from winning. In hard mode, the computer plays based on the mini-max machine learning algorithm, and cannot be beaten. A tie is the best possible outcome
for the user when the computer is playing in hard mode.

If the user chooses to simulate matches between two computer players, the level of each CPU can be picked individually.
